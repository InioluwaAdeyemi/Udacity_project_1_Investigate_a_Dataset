# TMDB Movie Data Analysis

I carried out an analysis on the TMDB movie dataset. The data set contains information,
about 10,000 movies obtained from The Movie Database(TMDB). The dataset consists of
columns providing information on Popularity, User ratings, movie budgets, revenue, cast
members, and genres. With a glance through information from the dataset I was able to pose
the following questions;

● What is the most popular movie of all time?
● What movie has the highest budget and revenue?
● Do user ratings have any effect on movie popularity?
● How do user ratings affect the revenue of a movie?
● Are movies with expensive budgets profitable?
● What is the movie with the highest Profit?
● Do User Ratings have any effect on Profit?
● Does Movie length affect the popularity of a movie?
● What is the year with the highest number of movie releases?

## Findings

The most popular movie of all time is Jurassic park, which is the fifth movie
with the highest revenue. Although it was not part of the top 10 movies with
the highest budget.
The movie with the highest budget: The Warrior's way, was not among the
top 10 most popular movies of all time, and nor was it among the top 10
movies with the highest revenue and profit. it's easy to conclude that people
didn't like it that much but that would be implying causation.
There was no correlation between User ratings and Popularity as well as
User ratings and revenue. So we cannot imply causation in the context of
how people's feelings affected the revenue and popularity of movies.
The movie with the highest revenue and profit is Avatar, which is ironic
seeing as it wasn't among the top 10 popular movies or the movies with the
highest budget, which proves that there is no correlation in this case
between profit and budget. Although there is a weak correlation between
user ratings and profit, we cannot still imply that Avatar had the highest
profits because it had high user ratings.
From our top 10 samples, we also observed that not all movies with
expensive budgets are profitable, honorable mention, The Warrior's Way
Furthermore based on our visualization, we conclude that the length of a
movie, that is runtime, has no effect on the popularity of the movie
Finally, we see that there is an increase in the trend of the number of movies
released each year. This shows that over the years, the movie industry has
thrived in an impressive way, proving that there is a demand for more each
year.
